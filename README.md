# Loto7
A program to emulate the Lottery Loto7

- Version 1.0:
Have the user choose from 2 options: 1. Enter seven 1-digit numbers (from 0-9) or 2. Have the program randomly generate them. Then the program will generate their own set of seven numbers. If the numbers the user chose or generated match the program's numbers, the player wins.
