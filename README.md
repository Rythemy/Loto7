# Loto7
## A program to emulate the Lottery Loto7

- Version 1.0:
Have the user choose from 2 options: 1. Enter seven 1-digit numbers (from 0-9) or 2. Have the program randomly generate them. Then the program will generate their own set of seven numbers. If the numbers the user chose or generated match the program's numbers, the player wins.
- Version 1.1:
Added Exception Handling.
- Version 1.2:
Changed the format: the numbers can only occur once, and instead of choosing from 0-9, it must be from 1-37 like in real Loto 7. The number list is also sorted from small to large.
- Version 1.3:
Introduced other prizes (1 to 6):  
1st prize: match all 7 numbers - $6,000,000  
2nd prize: match 6/7 numbers - $72,800  
3rd prize: match 5/7 numbers - $7,280  
4th prize: match 4/7 numbers - $91  
5th prize: match 3/7 numbers - $14  
6th prize: match 2/7 numbers - $3
